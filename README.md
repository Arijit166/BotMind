# BotMind

BotMind is a powerful, self-hosted WhatsApp bot that uses the Gemini AI model to provide intelligent, conversational responses in both private and group chats. Designed for personal use, this bot allows for seamless on/off control directly from within WhatsApp, giving you complete command over its activity without needing to touch the server.

## üöÄ Features

* **Intelligent AI Responses:** Powered by the cutting-edge Gemini AI model.
* **On/Off Control:** Activate or deactivate the bot's conversational ability via simple WhatsApp commands.
* **Group and Private Chat Support:** Works in both group settings and private chats.
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevents excessive API usage to keep costs in check.
* **Stateful Memory:** Remembers previous conversation context to provide more coherent responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
* A stable internet connection
* A dedicated, always-on server for hosting (e.g., VPS, Heroku)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BotMind.git
   cd BotMind
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    bash

    npm install
    ```
**Configure environment variables:**
Rename .env.example to .env and fill in your details. You will need a Gemini API key.

**Connect to WhatsApp:**
Start the bot for the first time to generate the session files. You'll need to scan a QR code with your WhatsApp app.
 ```
  bash

  npm start
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to link your WhatsApp account.
**Remember:** this bot will use your personal phone number as its identity.

## ü§ñ Usage

Once the bot is running, you can control it directly from your WhatsApp account:

**To turn the bot off:** Send the command /off in any chat with the bot.

**To turn the bot on:** Send the command /on in any chat with the bot.

Since the bot uses your personal phone number, you can issue these commands by messaging your own contact on WhatsApp.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Session Files**

The bot stores its session information in a file to avoid re-scanning the QR code every time it starts. By default, this file is created in a .wwebjs_auth folder.

To maintain portability, do not hardcode the session file path in config.js. Instead, use the .env file for configuration and refer to that variable in WhatsAppClient.js.

For example, if you set the path in .env like this:

```
SESSION_PATH=./sessions
Then in WhatsAppClient.js:
```

Then in WhatsAppClient.js
```
// Load session path from .env
const sessionPath = process.env.SESSION_PATH || '.wwebjs_auth';

// Use the session path
session: new FileSession(sessionPath),
```
This ensures your bot works seamlessly on any operating system without manual code changes.
